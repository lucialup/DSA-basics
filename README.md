## DSA-basics
Essential Algorithms and Data Structures for the Olympiad of Informatics (Romania). This is a guide covering the crucial algorithms and data structures needed for DSA competitions, the Olympiad, or job interviews. This resource aligns with the curriculum of the HLO advanced class.

Additionally, it's important to note that the algorithms in this collection are contained within C++ files, with each file representing a solution to a problem sourced from various online platforms. The first line of each source code file includes a comment containing the URL to the respective problem. As a practical exercise, students are encouraged to implement these solutions and submit them to the corresponding website to verify their correctness.
